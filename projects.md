## Projects

In the course on Theory of Programming and Types you have to work on a small project. This page documents some practical matters surrounding these projects.

### Procedure
1. Choose a team. Preferably of 2 people
1. Choose a problem to work on. Some suggestions can be found on the Course material page.
1. Present your research statement to your supervisor
1. Meet with supervisor. Your supervisor should be one of the lecturers
1. Discuss & research this topic
1. Present your results. We will hold a workshop during the exam time for every team to present.
1. Submit a report. See below.

### Criteria
The main focus of the project report and presentation should be the following:

* Research question. Identify a clear and motivated question to answer.
* Research contribution. Develop an implementation or new knowledge to answer the research question.
* Research method. Discuss how you arrived at your answer.
* Related work. Compare your answer with other contributions.

Of course, there is only limited time to work on your research. We expect a brief report, of just a couple of pages (in principle no more than 10 pages), and a short presentation (around 10 - 15 minutes).


## Research Projects

Here are a few brief project ideas. If you're interested in any particular topic, get in touch.

* Generic program construction
* Generic datatype coverage
* Generic program equality (under alpha-conversion, â€¦), and program diff
* Semantics of effects
* Verified compilers
* Implementing a memory bank in PiWare
* The Gilbreath Trick
* A verified functional pearl
